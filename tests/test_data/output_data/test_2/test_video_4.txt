 When it comes to washing your crawfish does a big debate if whether to add salt to purge them. You don't need to. I've been bowling for the past five years and I've never added salt while I'm washing crawfish. What you do is just add them to the crawfish tchikuzi, turn on your water, and then if you see any grass floating around, fish that out, and if there are dead crawfish, I call them straight tails, though that out as well. But notice how the water is really murky right now and once it runs clear, that's when your crawfish is ready.
