 What the heck is that red velvet cake? Alright, looks like they're cutting into triangles here. I don't think it's stacking on top of each other. Oh, look how next that pink icing looks. Oh, I can tell this is gonna be delicious already. Okay. I've never seen people make a cake like this though. It's only one slice. Usually they make the whole thing. What is that? Some kind of fondant? Nice, okay. They're doing the backside too. Very bright colors though. I like it. Oh, adding some wavy texture to it, what the heck? Oh, are they trying to make it look like a cartoon cake or something? A little cherry on top there too, okay? Oh, adding some black lines. Wait, no way. Oh, that's gonna make the whole thing pop. Oh, this looks so delicious, I'll definitely eat that. Oh, and a little candle too, nice! No way. Oh, subscribe if you'd eat that.
